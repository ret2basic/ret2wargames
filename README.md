# ret2wargames - Weekly practice audit wargame

## Introduction

"ret2wargames" is a weekly practice audit wargame.

What is a "practice audit"? It means auditing an audited codebase without looking after the report. After the practice audit, you can compare your findings with the report to see what you missed. I believe this is a better learning experience than reading tons of reports without knowing the context.

Each week I will pick a small codebase either from Code4rena or Sherlock and share it here. Some explanation of the concepts and study resources will be provided to make the practice audit more efficient.

**Participants are expected to finish Secureum bootcamp before doing this wargame.**

Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ret2basic) if you have questions regarding the practice audit.
