# ret2wargames - Weekly practice audit wargame

## Introduction

"ret2wargames" is a weekly practice audit wargame.

What is a "practice audit"? It means auditing an audited codebase without looking after the report. After the practice audit, you can compare your findings with the report to see what you missed. I believe this is a better learning experience than reading tons of reports without knowing the context.

Each week I will pick a small codebase either from Code4rena or Sherlock and share it here. Some explanation of the concepts and study resources will be provided to make the practice audit more efficient.

Participants are expected to finish Secureum bootcamp before doing this wargame. Feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ret2basic) if you have questions regarding the practice audit.
