# ret2wargames

## Introduction

"ret2wargames" is a weekly event that I run in [OpenSense Discord channel](https://discord.gg/opensense). The wargame contains two branches:

- In odd-number weeks, we go over a Secureum RACE. Participants should at least look at the contract briefly before the event.
- In even-number weeks, we live audit a past Code4rena/Sherlock contest. Participants should practice audit the codebase themselves before the event.

**Participants are expected to finish [Secureum bootcamp](https://github.com/x676f64/secureum-mind_map) before following along with this wargame.**

## Branch 1: Secureum RACEs

Secureum RACEs are 16-min smart contract auditing quizzes that are happening every month. First-time participants should read instructions in [Secureum Discord channel](https://discord.gg/q49xdRHbBa) and register for a RUN code. The quiz date will be announced in the "participate" channel.

## Branch 2: Practice Audits

What is a "practice audit"? It means auditing an audited codebase without looking after the report. After the practice audit, you can compare your findings with the report to see what you missed. I believe this is a better learning experience than reading tons of reports without knowing the context.

Every two weeks I will pick a small codebase from either Code4rena or Sherlock and share it here. Some explanation of the concepts and study resources will be provided to make the practice audit more efficient.
