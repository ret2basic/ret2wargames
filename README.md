# ret2wargames

## Introduction

"ret2wargames" is a weekly event that I am running in [OpenSense Discord server](https://discord.gg/opensense). The ret2wargames Epoch 0 will be a 8-week event where we go over Secureum RACEs, do practice audit for a past contest, or do Paradigm CTF prep.

**Participants are expected to finish [Secureum bootcamp](https://github.com/x676f64/secureum-mind_map) before following along with this wargame.** We will be covering intermediate-advanced content, so be prepared.

## Branch 1: Secureum RACEs

Secureum RACEs are 16-min smart contract auditing quizzes that are happening every month. First-time participants should read instructions in [Secureum Discord channel](https://discord.gg/q49xdRHbBa) and register for a RUN code. The quiz date will be announced in the "participate" channel.

## Branch 2: Paradigm CTF Prep

We are going to work through Paradigm CTF 2021 and 2022 challenges to prep this year's CTF.

## Branch 3: Practice Audits

What is a "practice audit"? It means auditing an audited codebase without looking after the report. After the practice audit, you can compare your findings with the report to see what you missed. I believe this is a better learning experience than reading tons of reports without knowing the context.

I will pick a small codebase/contract from either Code4rena or Sherlock and share it here. Some explanation of the concepts and study resources will be provided to make the practice audit more efficient.
