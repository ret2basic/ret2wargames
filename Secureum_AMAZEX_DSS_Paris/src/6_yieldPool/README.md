## **Challenge 6: Safe Yield?** 🏦📈

You got your hands on 0.1 ETH, and of course you would like to stack more. Luckily there's a promising DeFi protocol which allows depositors to earn fees on both dex swaps and flash loans from others. But it takes so long to earn any meaningful amount...

Can you do faster?

📌 Drain at least `100 ETH` from the yield pool.
