## **Challenge 1: Operation magic redemption** 🪄🔮

A prominent protocol, InsecStar, finds itself under attack. Their token, MagicETH (mETH), has been drained through an exploit in their borrow & loan protocol.

InsecStar has urgently summoned you to devise a method to recover the stolen tokens and redeem them for ETH before the situation worsens. This is a critical test of your capabilities. Can you rise to the occasion and secure the tokens, thereby reinforcing the strength and resilience of the Ethereum ecosystem?

📌 Recover `1000 mETH` from the *exploiter wallet*.

📌 Convert the `mETH` to `ETH` to avoid further losses.
